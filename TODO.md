#### Design Patterns
- **Dependency Injection**: Pass dependencies (e.g., `Evaluation` to `Search`) via templates or constructor parameters to decouple components and ease testing.
- **Command Pattern**: Model UCI commands as command objects (e.g., `UciCommandPosition`, `UciCommandGo`) for clean parsing and execution.
- **Facade**: Use the `Uci` class as a facade to orchestrate interactions between `Board`, `MoveGen`, `Search`, etc.
- **Strategy**: Define `Evaluation` as a pluggable strategy, selectable at compile time via templates for performance.

#### Concurrency Handling
- **Initial Design**: Start with a single-threaded search for simplicity.
- **Parallelization**: Extend `Search` to use `std::thread` for parallel tree exploration (e.g., Lazy SMP), with a shared transposition table protected by `std::mutex`.
- **Future Considerations**: Explore C++20 coroutines for asynchronous tasks, though traditional threading is sufficient for now.

#### Best Practices
- **Modern C++**: Use `constexpr` for compile-time constants (e.g., move tables), `std::optional` for nullable returns, and ranges for iteration.
- **Performance**: Avoid virtual functions in hot paths (e.g., move generation, evaluation); prefer static polymorphism via templates.
- **Code Organization**: Keep headers self-contained with forward declarations, use `.cpp` files for implementation to reduce compile-time dependencies.
- **Error Handling**: Use exceptions for UCI parsing errors, assertions for internal invariants.

#### Inspiration from Stockfish
- **Structure**: Adopt a similar modular breakdown (e.g., `bitboard.cpp`, `movegen.cpp`, `search.cpp`).
- **Optimizations**: Use precomputed tables and bit manipulation techniques, adapting them to C++20 idioms.
- **Caution**: Avoid direct code reuse due to Stockfishâ€™s GPL license; focus on conceptual inspiration.

#### Testing Strategies
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components (e.g., `Board::make_move`, `MoveGen::generate`) with known inputs/outputs using Google Test.
- **Perft Tests**: Validate move generation by comparing node counts at fixed depths against standard positions.
- **Integration Tests**: Simulate UCI command sequences to ensure end-to-end correctness.
- **Tools**: Use `valgrind` for memory safety, `perf` for profiling.
