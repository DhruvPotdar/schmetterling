- [ ] Rotated bitboards: Normally a bitboard will have one byte per rank of the chess board. This allows efficient determination of rook attacks across a rank by using a lookup table indexed by square and rank-occupied-byte (we need the occupied bitboard because rook attacks stop at the first occupied square in the line of sight).
A simple variation of the normal bitboard is to use a 90 degree rotated occupied bitboard, where each file of the chess board will be represented by one byte. In the same way as above, the rook attacks across a file can be determined.
We can also introduce 45 degrees left and right rotated occupied bitboards, where a left or right diagonal will be stored in one byte (actually in less than one byte). Using these bitboards and a table lookup we can determine bishop attacks. Queen attacks are obtained by or-ing the rook and bishop attacks
